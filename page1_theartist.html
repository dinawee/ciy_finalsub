                            <span>Hayao Miyazaki</span> is one of the many filmmaking gems produced by Japan, who revolutionized
                            the world of animation through his numerous works. The stalwarts of world cinema like Akira Kurosawa
                            as well as movies like 'The Tales of The White Serpent' sparked his interest and he eventually
                            landed up pursuing a career in animation. After taking up a few assignments at a corporate animation
                            studio, Miyazaki learnt the nuances of animation filmmaking at an early stage of his career.

                            The creator’s big plunge into the world of animation was the film titled 'Hols: Prince of the sun', which went on to garner
                            a lot of acclaim. Since then, there has been no looking back for this animator, who has mesmerized
                            audiences worldwide through many of his fine works. He has addressed various themes plaguing
                            the society, such as the environment as well as feminism through his works.

                            This popular director has been honored on many occasions at various award ceremonies and two of his splendid works have been
                            honored with as many as ten awards. Miyazaki has finally hung his boots after a long and path-breaking
                            career in animation. However, he continues to be a great source of inspiration from many people
                            from the younger generation to venture into the field of animation.
